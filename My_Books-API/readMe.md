# API for My Books.

## Purpose:
Mainly to practice and learn to build Express servers and APIs. I wanted to build this in such a way that it could be used by or "plugged into" different clients. 
Conceptually this is a bit different than other backends I've written and made me rethink the reusability of some of the routes and logic.
